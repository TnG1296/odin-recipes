    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Apart from their delectable taste, hot dogs are favoured by many because they're very easy to cook. </p>
        <p>They can be fried or grilled and they cook in no time</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>1 hot dog (or as many more as you need)</li>
        <li>1 hot dog bun (or as many more as you need)</li>
        <li>Condiments</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>First, prepare a fire. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Grab long-handled tongs, which are ideal, or a long-handled skewer made for roasting dogs and marshmallows</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Hold the hot dog a few inches above the tops of the flames. Slowly rotate the dog while cooking until the skin is charred and crisp and the interior is cooked through 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>plonk the hot dog in a bun and slather it with condiments</li>
